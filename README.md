# Goals 
Im going to start of by stating the goal of this project was newer to maka a Java competitor to Unity or Unreal engine 4. i am not that delutional. 
however i instead wanted to create at framework for making cute little games in java, that had the look and fell of old video games from the 80's ... ish ... and hopefully learn a thing or two about Modular software and components systems. As well as finaly learning how to structure and organice a git project. ^,.,^

## Features
The framework has a few unique features. it is build around being as ligthweigth (in terms of Megabytes used.) as posible, while relieng on as few components from java as posible, as well as be able to swap out the colorpallete on the go. because of these restriction a new file format was created for the Engine as well as a screenbuffer.

the framework also comes with it's own set of tools, for ease of use. 
- map editor. 
- sprite editor.
- image converter.
